# # Basic information about a data frame
using DataFrames

# Let's start by creating a `DataFrame` object, `x`, so that we can learn how to get information on that data frame.
x = DataFrame(A=[1, 2], B=[1.0, missing], C=["a", "b"])

# The standard `size` function works to get dimensions of the `DataFrame`,
size(x), size(x, 1), size(x, 2)

# as well as `nrow` and `ncol` from R.
nrow(x), ncol(x)

# `describe` gives basic summary statistics of data in your `DataFrame` (check out the help of `describe` for information on how to customize shown statistics).
describe(x)

# you can limit the columns shown by `describe` using `cols` keyword argument
describe(x, cols=1:2)

# `names` will return the names of all columns as strings
names(x)

# you can also get column names with a given element type (`eltype`):
names(x, String)

# use `propertynames` to get a vector of `Symbol`s:
propertynames(x)

# `eltype` on `eachcol(x)` returns element types of columns:
eltype.(eachcol(x))

# Here we create some large `DataFrame`
y = DataFrame(rand(1:10, 1000, 10), :auto)

# and then we can use `first` to peek into its first few rows
first(y, 5)

# and `last` to see its bottom rows.
last(y, 3)

# Using `first` and `last` without number of rows will return a first/last `DataFrameRow` in the `DataFrame`
first(y)

#---
last(y)

# ## Displaying large data frames
# Create a wide and tall data frame:
df = DataFrame(rand(100, 100), :auto)

# we can see that 92 of its columns were not printed. Also we get its first 30 rows. You can easily change this behavior by changing the value of `ENV["LINES"]` and `ENV["COLUMNS"]`.
withenv("LINES" => 10, "COLUMNS" => 200) do
    show(df)
end

# ### Most elementary get and set operations
# Given the `DataFrame` `x` we have created earlier, here are various ways to grab one of its columns as a `Vector`.
x = DataFrame(A=[1, 2], B=[1.0, missing], C=["a", "b"])

# all get the vector stored in our DataFrame without copying it
x.A, x[!, 1], x[!, :A]

# the same using string indexing
x."A", x[!, "A"]

# note that this creates a copy
x[:, 1]

#---
x[:, 1] === x[:, 1]

# To grab one row as a `DataFrame`, we can index as follows.
x[1:1, :]

# this produces a DataFrameRow which is treated as 1-dimensional object similar to a NamedTuple
x[1, :]

# We can grab a single cell or element with the same syntax to grab an element of an array.
x[1, 1]

# or a new `DataFrame` that is a subset of rows and columns
x[1:2, 1:2]

# You can also use `Regex` to select columns and `Not` from InvertedIndices.jl both to select rows and columns
x[Not(1), r"A"]

# `!` indicates that underlying columns are not copied
x[!, Not(1)]

# `:` means that the columns will get copied
x[:, Not(1)]

# Assignment of a scalar to a data frame can be done in ranges using broadcasting:
x[1:2, 1:2] .= 1
x

# Assignment of a vector of length equal to the number of assigned rows using broadcasting
x[1:2, 1:2] .= [1, 2]
x

# Assignment or of another data frame of matching size and column names, again using broadcasting:
x[1:2, 1:2] .= DataFrame([5 6; 7 8], [:A, :B])
x

#===
**Caution**

With `df[!, :col]` and `df.col` syntax you get a direct (non copying) access to a column of a data frame.
This is potentially unsafe as you can easily corrupt data in the `df` data frame if you resize, sort, etc. the column obtained in this way.
Therefore such access should be used with caution.

Similarly `df[!, cols]` when `cols` is a collection of columns produces a new data frame that holds the same (not copied) columns as the source `df` data frame. Similarly, modifying the data frame obtained via `df[!, cols]` might cause problems with the consistency of `df`.

The `df[:, :col]` and `df[:, cols]` syntaxes always copy columns so they are safe to use (and should generally be preferred except for performance or memory critical use cases).
===#

# Here are examples of how `Cols` and `Between` can be used to select columns of a data frame.
x = DataFrame(rand(4, 5), :auto)

#---
x[:, Between(:x2, :x4)]

#---
x[:, Cols("x1", Between("x2", "x4"))]

# ## Views
# You can simply create a view of a `DataFrame` (it is more efficient than creating a materialized selection). Here are the possible return value options.
@view x[1:2, 1]

#---
@view x[1, 1]

# a DataFrameRow, the same as for x[1, 1:2] without a view
@view x[1, 1:2]

# a SubDataFrame
@view x[1:2, 1:2]

# ## Adding new columns to a data frame
df = DataFrame()

# using `setproperty!` (element assignment)
x = [1, 2, 3]
df.a = x
df

# no copy is performed (sharing the same memory address)
df.a === x

# using `setindex!`
df[!, :b] = x
df[:, :c] = x
df

# no copy is performed
df.b === x

# With copying
# `!` and `:` has different effects
df.c === x

# Element-wise assignment
df[!, :d] .= x
df[:, :e] .= x
df

# both copy, so in this case `!` and `:` has the same effect
df.d === x, df.e === x

# note that in our data frame columns `:a` and `:b` store the vector `x` (not a copy)
df.a === df.b === x

# This can lead to silent errors. For example this code leads to a bug (note that calling `pairs` on `eachcol(df)` creates an iterator of (column name, column) pairs):
try
    for (n, c) in pairs(eachcol(df))
        println("$n: ", pop!(c))
    end
catch e
    show(e)
end

# note that for column `:b` we printed `2` as `3` was removed from it when we used `pop!` on column `:a`.
# Such mistakes sometimes happen. Because of this DataFrames.jl performs consistency checks before doing an expensive operation (most notably before showing a data frame).
try
    show(df)
catch e
    show(e)
end

# We can investigate the columns to find out what happened:
collect(pairs(eachcol(df)))

# The output confirms that the data frame `df` got corrupted.
# DataFrames.jl supports a complete set of `getindex`, `getproperty`, `setindex!`, `setproperty!`, `view`, broadcasting, and broadcasting assignment operations. The details are explained here: http://juliadata.github.io/DataFrames.jl/latest/lib/indexing/.

# ## Comparisons
using DataFrames

#---
df = DataFrame(rand(2, 3), :auto)

#---
df2 = copy(df)

# compares column names and contents
df == df2

# create a minimally different data frame and use `isapprox` for comparison
df3 = df2 .+ eps()

#---
df == df3

#---
isapprox(df, df3)

#---
isapprox(df, df3, atol=eps() / 2)

# `missings` are handled as in Julia Base
df = DataFrame(a=missing)

# Equality test shows missing.
df == df

# The same object?
df === df

#---
isequal(df, df)
